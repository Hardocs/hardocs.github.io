# How to help out

The reason you are reading this is great! Probably you came here to see what this is all about and maybe to contribute your piece for a better worldüåç.

## Steps to contribute:
1. Find a project you like on Airtable
2. Get in contact with the project members.
3. Have a look at the tasks related to this project
4. Let everyone know that you are doing a specific task
5. Get sh*t done
6. Let us know you did it and how it went, or recommended follow-ups
7. Celebrate that you just made the world a tiny bit better!
