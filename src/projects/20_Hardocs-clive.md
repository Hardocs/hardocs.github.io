# Hardocs Project Review - Initiating Phase
<p style="text-align: center;">Clive Steward, San Diego, 28 Nov 2020</p>

## Introduction

This should be an adequately formal report, but I feel it worthwhile to mention something up front, about how unusual an experience our time with the project has been.

Our intentions have been very much to return value to our sponsors by arriving at something fresh -- and concrete -- in the progress of OPEN, FAIR, and especially, co-creative principles.

We've worked to make here, as a basis, a tool that can simplify and make actually attractive, the creation of summary documentation side-by-side with its all-important metadata, both of which drive the ability to discover, and thus to connect, to design and construct with the participations of others.

In concert, we've created a cloud-based framework which can both entirely protect project privacy, and then at an agreeable point of ownership choice, share results globally. As a first principle to this control of essential security, there is a solid platform which makes use of the most dependable identity determination available.

## Anticipation, for moving forward

It could be appreciated that even at the prototype level we've arrived at, and especially with the solid architectural foundation supporting it, this is something more than could normally be expected from a short period with a small, and truly international team.

There has, then, been a combination of intensity, cooperative work in every regard, daily enthusiasm, and frankly, many hours of donated effort above what a contract may provide, which has brought our shared experience in this result.

The problem promised a great enough if quiet potential, and each person involved responded to what it looked like we could do, and as we discovered by research and trials, how far we could go, bring this forwards.

Looking ahead, and with the benefit perhaps of some years of innovative and elaborative projects through consulting, it's well to appreciate what can be brought forward from here -- and that it will necessarily have a different intensity as scope, new persons involved, and the real magnitude of effort in filling out full capabilities grow the result into more and more practical, actualized application.

In particular, we'll need to take the time, the more relaxed approach, and the true patience for the practices which will allow the actual potentials of *co-creation* on this project itself to be effective, to shine through. And that would be entirely appropriate, one would feel, to the intentions we'd like to fulfill.

## A moment's pause for theory

If one were to take one model for what this might mean, they might well refer to the Reflective Practices of development, due to the late Donald Sch√∂n, a truly generous intellectual and person, who worked very much into a practical world, and once into the popular world, giving a Reith Lecture for the BBC, from his homes in academia.

 He was in fact instrumental in approaches we may have heard of, such as the Learning Organization, given over to his graduate students; and his depth of acutely penetrative thinking, expressed often through the means  of interrogated examples and analogies, may offer very much to a person who finds the chance to consider them.

## Contents of our today's Delivery

There are really two portions, connected by architecture and application interfaces, while not yet fully integrated in this delivery.

### Preparing information for sharing

There is the combined documentation summaries and metadata editor, which has had several hands involved in it, which Jose Urra will detail.

We could mention here important facts of its flexible abilities, which include:

 - a quite nice environment to write summary documentation in, able to copy and paste content besides text such as diagrams and images, which are automatically treated to suit the needs of highly efficient internet sharing. For example, giant snapshots so often convenient from cameras will end up very visible, with their form also suitably web-sized.
- that the capability is already developed to import material from other formats that a project's full documentation may have been preferred to write in, such as Markdown or Microsoft Word
- and that the metadata creation editor itself has a fine toolset to agreeably streamline this process, providing click-to-enter selections which bring the features of complex real-life metadata schemas into easy and comfortable use. Thus making them 'possible', as we might say...

### Providing the ways to share the information

## Co-creation's dimensions: availability

### of project data

### of our frameworks

## Where can we go from here?
### Next practical steps - would be straightforward

### Recompense
