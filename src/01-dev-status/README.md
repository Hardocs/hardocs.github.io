# Source code main repositories
All hardocs repositories are open source and can be found under [hardocs github organization](https://github.com/Hardocs).

## Desktop app
[Repository](https://github.com/Hardocs/desktop-app)

Hardocs electron desktop app presenting current docs editing functionalities.
**Supports**:
- Creation of hardocs documentation projects.
- Rich editing of documents in html.
- Basic editing of metadata files.

## Basis editor application
[Repository](https://github.com/Hardocs/basis-app-framework)

This is the Research and Development co-creation experiment integrating and testing core architectural capabilities that include:
- Exploration of different editors.
- Integration with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to support multiple document formats.
- [Pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/) for local first documents database.
- Integration and synchronization with the cloud database developed in [couchdb](https://couchdb.apache.org/).

## Habitat client
[Repository](https://github.com/Hardocs/habitat-client)

This is the developing client-side api for Hardocs, as an npm module.
This npm module handles core services consumed by HARDOCS desktop apps including local operations with the file system and pouch db, as well as cloud operations.

## Habitat cloud
[Repository](https://github.com/Hardocs/habitat-hd)

This is the current discovery and development implementation of Habitat, the secure cloud service for the emerging abilities of Hardocs.

With full high-grade identity-based security from the beginning,
it is operational with a fundamental control and command set for
Hardocs, in a Linux droplet accessible via internet connection,
demonstrable via a panel of our Hardocs Application Framework.

For a better understanding of the cloud capabilities now and into
a future, please refer to the Hardocs Project Review, particularly the section [Providing ways to share the information](https://hardocs.github.io/01-dev-status/20_Clive.html#providing-the-ways-to-share-the-information), thank you.


## Hardocs Application Framework
[Repository](https://github.com/Hardocs/basis-app-framework)

This framework has been as evolutionary as originally intended, as our possibilities and insights have emerged, become reflected in the Hardocs architecture.

It's been our foundation for proving approaches and interfaces that nicely work, so that the results of our researches all along have been the increasing degrees of invitingly operational Hardocs.
