# Design premises
## Enable FAIR principles by design
The implementation of frameworks and tools for communities of practice determine the likelihood to adopt FAIR principles. We have to make tools that make FAIR desirable, evident and necessesary, and not an extra step that require a lot of effort and complexity in the workflow of users.

## Support local and offline first workflows
- Users should be able to edit and document in the context of their local projects which tend to exist in the file system of the users.computers.
- In software documentation projects tend to live close to the source code, and digital objects associated with the documentation and metadata. Very similar to software contemporary workflows.

## Support the use of standards for different knowledge domains
- We should enable the import and usage of standards specified in formats like [json schemas](https://json-schema.org/) or [xml schemas](https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/schema).

## Easy metadata editing in local environments
- Users should be able to use metadata standards easily in the context of their project documents and repositories.
- Metadata should be easy to generate and edit in local environments. 
- Metadata should be easy to publish once created locally.
- Metadata should be easy to add during documentation and develop organically during the actual project development not only after projects are finished.

## Private first collaboration
- Projects should be first private and then public when users decide is the time to share their documents.

## Integrate with the cloud using a hybrid approach
- Respecting the local first principle, the documents and databases can also be shared and managed openly or in closed groups.
