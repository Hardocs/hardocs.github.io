## Methodology
Hardocs has been developed as a co-creation activity that involved several design iterations, usability feedback and software development activities. 

> Reflection on co-creation
> Co-creation in this context is about exploring general ideas and specify possibilities, architectures and designs that realize such ideas. Unlike some software projects where a given technology stack and use cases are given, we focused on exploring use cases and develop possible solutions in a more open ended approach.

### Learning from real hardware documentation experiences focused on covid related hardware
- The project gathered a lot of information and learnings from the [combatcovid.equipment](https://combatcovid.equipment/) project developed by this same team. This allowed us to learn about how people create, publish and share hardware projects using common tools like markdown, git repositories and github.
- We explored this tool and workflow with 33 participants and created about 20 documentation projects.
- This information and feedback was used for the second iteration to improve documentation workflows.

### Defined clear goals and references
- We used some tools from [domain driven design](https://www.dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/#:~:text=Domain%2Ddriven%20design%20(DDD),complex%20designs%20on%20a%20model) to develop an overall model of the app and its services.

### Specifying requirements and exploring possible solutions
- We researched for solutions and examples to verify the feasibility of the requirements.
- Defined a technology stack to develop this framework. 

### Software and open source development workflows
- See our [project documentation](https://github.com/Hardocs/desktop-app/projects/2) and discussion to clarify specific challenges that need to be tackled.

### Integrating and reusing available open source solutions
- Our app is entirely based on available open source tools and components. This allowed us to explore very fast the possibilities, challenges and customizations needed to articulate the design vision and implement it.
